1. Create a function called `getNumberEntries` that takes in one param - a purchase object. This function should
iterate through the object and return a new array of subarrays. Each subarray should include the key and the value
from the object if the value is a a number datatype. Do not use Object.keys, Object.values or other Object methods
in your implementation.
```javascript
// example output
getNumberEntries(purchases[0]); // [ ['quantity', 2 ], ['price', 12.99] ]
```

2. Create a function called `addKeyValuePairs` that takes in two parameters - `object` and `additions`. `object` 
represents a purchase object; `additions` represents an array of subarrays, where each subarray is a key and a value
to add to the input object. This function should add each subarray's key and value to the object and return the object.
```javascript
addKeyValuePairs(purchases[1], [ ['purchasedPreviously', false], ['initiatedReturn', true] ]);
// =>
{
    product: "LG Bluray Player Replacement Remote Control",
    category: "Electronics",
    quantity: 1,
    price: 6.99,
    purchasedPreviously: false,
    initiatedReturn: true,
    mostLikedReviews: [
      {
        rating: 1,
        text: "Product didn't come with batteries."
      },
      {
        rating: 2,
        text: "Package was damaged."
      }
    ]
  }
```

3. Create a function called `filterByPrice` that takes in two parameters - `array` and `price`. `array` represents
an an array of purchase objects; `price` is a number representing a price. This function should use the native filter
method to return a new array of only the items in the input array whose prices are greater than the input price.
```javascript
filterByPrice(purchases, 20); // => [ {Luxardo Gourmet Cocktail Cherries}, {Blood Pressure Monitor} ]
```

4. Create a function called `mapPurchases` that takes in one parameter - `array` - which represents an array of 
purchase objects. This function should use the native map method to return a new array of strings where each string
includes the product's title uppercased and the most recent review text.
```javascript
// example output
mapPurchases(purchases);
// =>
[
  "ERGOFIT WIRED EARBUDS - Review: Great noise-cancelling feature.",
  "LG BLURAY PLAYER REPLACEMENT REMOTE CONTROL - Review: Package was damaged.",
  "MCCORMICK GRILL MATES CHIPOTLE PEPPER MARINADE (12 PK) - Review: The marinade packets were damaged.",
  "LUXARDO GOURMET COCKTAIL CHERRIES - Review: I use these all the time for parties.",
  "BLOOD PRESSURE MONITOR - Review: Matches my blood pressure at the doctor's office."
]
```

5. Create a function called `accumulateString` that takes in one pararemeter - `array` - which reprsesents an array
of purchae objects. This function should use the native reduce method to iterate over the input array of purchases.
At each iteration, it should use the purchase's quantity value to grab the corresponding word in the product description
and add that to the output string it's accumulating. For instance, if the purchases quantity is 1, you should access the 
first word in the product description; if the purchases quantity is 2, you should access the second word in the product
description.
```javascript
// example
accumulateString(purchases); // => "WiredLGMatesLuxardoBlood"
```
